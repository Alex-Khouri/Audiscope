========================================
***** (1) System Requirements *****

MINIMUM
CPU: Dual Core @ 2.0GHz
RAM: 8GB

RECOMMENDED
CPU: Quad Core @ 2.5GHz
RAM: 16GB

NB: This application's peak memory consumption is determined by the size of the audio files that are being processed, and can be estimated using the following formula:
Memory Consumed = 1GB + 2x (where 'x' is the size of audio file being processed in GB)
========================================
***** (2) Application Usage Guide *****

This application can be used to find artifacts in audio files generated by signal processors. It analyses the signal variance across the audio duration, then generates a graph of the results.

The following types of audio can analysed:
    * Music
    * Sine Tones
    * Noise (White, Pink, etc)

When analysing a music loop, users can provide an estimate of the loop's length using maximum and minimum values, or they can specify the length using musical metrics (i.e. tempo and number of beats). The application can also detect the loop length automatically, but this method is slow. When analysing sine tones or noise, the program will treat the signal as a series of short loops.

This application also includes a linear audio scanner, which can analyse the integrity of both looped and non-looped recordings by measuring frame loss probability. Multiple scanning algorithms are available, and they can be combined to increase the chance of successful detection.

If the audio recording is split across multiple files, they can be loaded into this application collectively and will be treated as a single stream. Multiple batches can also be loaded, in order to process multiple recordings in one continuous operation. The scanners can only process audio files up to 4.2GB, but the file splitter can be used to break up large WAV files into smaller ones.

Maximum Supported Audio Quality: 32-bit/96.0 kHz
Supported Audio File Formats: AIF, AIFF, AU, WAV
    (File splitter only supports WAV)
========================================
***** (3) Running this Application on Mac *****

To run this application on MacOS for the first time, do the following:

1) Right-click the `Audiscope` file and press `Open`.
    NB: MacOS will display a warning and prevent the application from running
2) Navigate to `System Settings` -> `Privacy & Security`.
3) Click `Allow` next to `Audiscope` or `Java` (depending on which one appears).

After doing this, you should be able to run the application by double-clicking the 'Audiscope' file.
========================================
***** (4) Checking the Installed Application Version *****

1) Run the application.
2) Click the 'Options' button in the top-right corner of the opening screen.
3) The application version should be displayed along the top row.
========================================
***** (5) Build Instructions *****

1) Download and install the full edition of the Liberica JDK from the Bellsoft website. This JDK distribution is required because it includes the JavaFX library (as oppose to using JavaFX as a 3rd-party module).

2) Create the following directory structure:
(NB: You can use any name for the project's root directory, but this example uses "Audiscope")
----------------------------------------
Audiscope
--- CSS
--- JAR
--- Java
--- JRE
------- Linux ARM.zip
------- Linux x86.zip
------- Mac ARM.zip
------- Mac x86.zip
------- Windows ARM.zip
------- Windowx x86.zip
--- Releases
--- Scripts
------- Build
----------- Linux
----------- Mac
----------- Windows
------- Push
----------- Linux
----------- Mac
----------- Windows
------- Run
----------- Linux
----------- Mac
----------- Windows
----------------------------------------

3) Place the project's files in their corresponding directories.

4) Ensure that the corresponding JRE folder for your system is extracted into the 'JRE' folder (e.g. JRE/Linux x86), and contains the contents of the full edition of the Liberica JRE from Bellsoft. This can be obtained from the Bellsoft website or from this project's repository.

5) Copy the following files and folders into the project's root directory:
    * The corresponding build script for your system (e.g. "build_linux.sh")
    * The "readme.txt" file

6) Run the build script (the generated application versions will be found inside the 'Releases' folder).
========================================
***** (6) Managing the Bundled Java Runtime Environment *****

The following standard Java libraries are not used by this application, and are therefore removed from the bundled Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in order to save space:
    * jfxwebkit
        The corresponding files can be found at the following locations:
            JRE/Linux ARM/lib/libjfxwebkit.so
            JRE/Linux x86/lib/libjfxwebkit.so
            JRE/Mac ARM/lib/libjfxwebkit.dylib
            JRE/Mac x86/lib/libjfxwebkit.dylib
            JRE/Windows x86/bin/jfxwebkit.dll
            (NB: This library isn't included in the Windows ARM version of the JRE)

If these files are not manually removed from the aforementioned directories, they will be automatically excluded from the final release files that are generated by the build scripts.
